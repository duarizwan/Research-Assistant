📝 Abstract: In this paper, we study the mathematical program with equilibrium constraints
(MPEC) formulated as a mathematical program with a parametric generalized
equation involving the regular normal cone. We derive a new necessary
optimality condition which is sharper than the usual M-stationary condition an...
