## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Gemini AI API key

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
GENAI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

5. Start the backend server:

```bash
python main.py
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

- Ensure `GENAI_API_KEY` is set in the `.env` file
- Check that port 8000 is available
- Verify Python dependencies are installed in the virtual environment

### Frontend Issues

- Ensure Node.js version is 16 or higher
- Check that port 3000 is available
- Verify the backend is running on port 8000

### Download Issues

- Check Downloads directory permissions
- Ensure internet connection for arXiv access
- Verify sufficient disk space

### API Rate Limits

- Gemini API has rate limits for summary generation
- The system includes automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Large download batches may take time due to rate limiting
